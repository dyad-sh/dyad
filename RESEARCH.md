# Research on CPU-Friendly Reinforcement Learning Frameworks

This document summarizes the research on CPU-friendly reinforcement learning (RL) frameworks for the multi-agent system.

## The Challenge

The user requested to use the Agent Reinforcement Trainer (ART) framework, but it requires a GPU for training. The user wants a solution that works on a CPU. Therefore, I researched alternative RL frameworks that are more lightweight and CPU-friendly.

## Candidates

I investigated the following frameworks:

- **ElegantRL**: A lightweight and stable deep reinforcement learning library.
- **Tensorforce**: A reinforcement learning library for TensorFlow.
- **MushroomRL**: A PyTorch-based reinforcement learning library.
- **pyqlearning**: A library for Q-Learning and Deep Q-Networks.

## Recommendation: ElegantRL

After reviewing the documentation and articles about these frameworks, I recommend using **ElegantRL**.

### Why ElegantRL?

1.  **Lightweight and CPU-Friendly**: The library is designed to be lightweight, with a small core codebase. This makes it a good candidate for running on a CPU without requiring a powerful machine.
2.  **Actor-Critic Framework**: It's based on the Actor-Critic framework, which is a natural fit for our Coder/Reviewer multi-agent system. The Coder can be the "Actor" that generates the code, and the Reviewer can be the "Critic" that evaluates the code and provides feedback (reward).
3.  **Good Documentation and Tutorials**: The project has good documentation and tutorials, which will make it easier to integrate with our existing system.
4.  **Python-based**: It's a Python library, which is the standard for machine learning and reinforcement learning.

### Integration Plan

To integrate ElegantRL into our project, we will need to:

1.  **Create a Python RL Service**: We will create a new Python service that will be responsible for the reinforcement learning part of the system. This service will use the ElegantRL library to train the agents.
2.  **Create a Custom Gym Environment**: We will need to create a custom OpenAI Gym environment that represents the interaction between our Coder and Reviewer agents. The environment will define the state space, action space, and the reward function.
3.  **Connect TypeScript and Python**: We will need to establish a communication channel between our main TypeScript application and the new Python RL service. We can use a simple HTTP server (like Flask or FastAPI) in the Python service to expose an API that the TypeScript application can call.

This approach will allow us to keep the core application in TypeScript while leveraging the power of Python and ElegantRL for the reinforcement learning part.

## Next Steps

The next step is to create a new plan to implement this integration. This will be a significant undertaking that will involve creating a new Python service, a custom Gym environment, and the communication layer between the two.
